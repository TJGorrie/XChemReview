# Staging
## What should I do
Consider each structure that is described in the main table. We are expecting a response for every crystal so please pick any crystal and submit a response to it.
You should be able to click any row which will then auto-populate the form with the crystal name and then take you to a NGL viewer to show the structure and electron density. The viewer may not reflect your preferred method of viewing structures so please use the provided file-paths if you prefer to use an alternative program.

## Submitting a Response
When you want to submit a response, click on a row (taking you to the NGL viewer) OR select the crystal from a drop-down box. Please select your decision and supply one or more reasons provided that reflects your response. These responses will be updated regularly, once you click submit you will be taken back to the main page. Alternatively, if you select the wrong crystal, change the selected crystal on the form or click the back button.

There are no limits for the number of forms you can submit.

## I submitted a form I didn't mean to!
We only show the most recent responses for structures as we expect the decisions to change over-time. And after the staging process we expect that the final (most-recent) decision made will stick. If you disagree with the current decision you can change the decision yourself, by clicking on the row and submitting a new response.
