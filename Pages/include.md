# Staging
## What should I do
Consider each structure that is described in the main table, and review any particular structures using the NGL viewer provided or your own prefferred tools.

## Flagging a Crystal
If you find a structure that you are not happy with. Please fill out the form available in the side-panel, selecting the structure you wish the flag and then supplying a reason from the drop down box. 

If you wish to submit multiple forms for different crystals or even for the same crystal - please submit multiple forms.

## I submitted a form I didn't mean to!
Please email Tyler at tyler.gorrie-stone@diamond.ac.uk with the timestamp (see Responses table) and we will remove the response downstream.
