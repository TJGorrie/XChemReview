## What should I do?
Consider each structure that is described in the main table. We are expecting a response for each crystal in the table so please pick any crystal and submit a response.

You should be able to click on any row which will load the crystal into the NGL viewer and also select it in the form. Please fill out the rest of the form yourself and once finished please click submit to add your response to the table. 

The viewer may not reflect your preferred method of viewing structures so please use the provided file-paths if you prefer to use an alternative program.

## Submitting a Response
When you want to submit a response, click on a row (taking you to the NGL viewer) OR select the crystal from a drop-down box. Please select your decision and supply one or more reasons provided that reflects your response. You are able to add your own reasons if you do not think the suggested reasons reflect the decision. Additionally please provide any specific comments that you have about the crystal in the small comment window.

If you select the wrong crystal, simply change the selected crystal on the form or click the clear button to start again.

There are no limits for the number of forms you can submit.

## I submitted a form I didn't mean to!
We only show the most recent responses for structures as we expect the decisions to change over-time. And after the staging process we expect that the final (most-recent) decision made will stick. If you disagree with the current decision you can change the decision yourself, by clicking on the row and submitting a new response.

## I clicked a protein but I cannot see a protein/electron density
If you do not see a protein try clicking the defaults button otherwise the pdb file may be missing. If you see the structure but no electron density this will be due to the event maps, 2fofc and fofcs not being found on the diamond file-system where the pdb structure is.

## The electron densities are not aligned properly
Due to how NGL viewer works, the electron density maps need to be centered around the ligand to be viewed properly.
